A brief pulse in pelagic production was recorded, but the bloom did not last long. The fate of sympagic algae might depend on the timing and size of the pulse released (Tedesco et al., 2012; Selz et al., 2017). In two consecutive seasons in the high Arctic, an early and rapid release of sympagic algae initiated a pelagic bloom, yet in another season when the release of sympagic microalgae occurred only towards summer, no such effect was recorded (Galindo et al., 2014).
