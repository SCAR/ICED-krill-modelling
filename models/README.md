## Models

Dia files and other data associated with the qualitative models.

Notes about file name suffixes:
"simplified" means that interactions have been simplified where possible. This is still formatted with colour-coding and legend for easier interpretation. The following file suffixes have the formatting removed for reading in R: "certain" includes only certain interactions. "certainAndUncertain" includes certain and uncertain interactions. "certainAndSmall" includes certain and small effect-sized interactions. "all" includes interactions of all classification types. All formatting has been removed for reading in R
